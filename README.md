# GpsLocation
It's a small project consist of one activity and on service. In service part I have included code which get location from gps after interval time.
In activity part, I have made a button which get location from the service. In this project I have used bind service so the whole code is about how
to create bind service then how to start and stop from activity and how to access method and attribute from the service in activity.


It's simple code and easay to understand If you still have an issue you can email me.
